Narrator: It was a day just as any other when I received the letter. I woke up early, as I always do, to tend to my morning chores. I ate breakfast with my family, went into town to run errands, and returned eager to dig into a new novel. After a few more chores, I sat in my chair by the window and read until dinner started…
Narrator: As soon as I sat down I could tell something was amiss. We said grace and started eating. My mother told me I received a letter from my Uncle Wilfred. I was confused having never heard of an uncle by the name. Considering I never heard him mentioned before, I assumed the letter would be unimportant. I was very, very wrong…
Narrator: Apparently my Uncle Wilfred had passed away and, for reasons I still cannot comprehend, he left all his property to me. 
Narrator: Shocked, my family had a long discussion about what we should do. My parents cannot leave the farm or my siblings long enough to sort this out, nor can we all afford to travel to England. So here I am, in a carriage trudging through the rain to lead me to my new life as the Owner of Banks Manor.
